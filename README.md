Project: Predicting Car Prices using Used Car Data
This project aims to analyze and visualize data from a used car dataset (available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toramky/automobile-dataset/data) to predict car prices. We will follow a structured approach involving the following steps:  
1. Data Acquisition and Preparation:
•	Obtain the used car dataset from the provided URL.
•	Pre-process the data in Python to handle missing values, format it appropriately, and perform normalization or binning if necessary.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Analyze the data to gain insights into car prices and related features.
•	This will involve calculating descriptive statistics, performing grouping analysis (groupby), analyzing variance , and exploring correlations between features and car prices.
5. Model Development:
•	We will develop and compare two machine learning models for car price prediction: 
o	Simple Linear Regression - Uses a single feature to predict car price.
o	Multiple Linear Regression - Uses multiple features to predict car price.
6. Model Review and Evaluation:
•	We will evaluate the performance of each model using various techniques: 
o	Generate regression plots to visualize the relationship between predicted and actual prices.
o	Analyze the distribution of errors to identify potential biases.
